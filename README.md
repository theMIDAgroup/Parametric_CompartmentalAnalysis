# Parametric_CompartmentalAnalysis-
Matlab Graphic User Interface (GUI) for parametric compartmental analysis of kidneys and tumor for the FDG uptake in murine models 

The code is based on the following publication:

* 2017 Scussolini M, Garbarino S, Sambuceti S, Caviglia G and Piana M "A physiology--based parametric imaging method for FDG--PET data", Inverse Problems 33 125010 


A GUI is provided for the following compartmental systems:

    a standard 2D compartmental model for reversible FDG uptake. See for instance [2002 Gunn, R.N., Gunn, S.R., Turkheimer, F.E., Aston, J.A. and Cunningham, V.J. "Positron emission tomography compartmental models: a basis pursuit strategy for kinetic modeling", Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism, 22(12), pp.1425-1439] for oncological applications.

    a (3+1)D compartmental model for FDG kinetic in the kidneys [2014 Garbarino S, Caviglia G, Sambuceti G, Benvenuto F and Piana M "A novel description of FDG excretion in the renal system: application to metformin-treated models" Physics in Medicine and Biology, 59, 2469-2484]
